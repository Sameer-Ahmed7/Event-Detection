# Project Title:
Event Detection

# Overview:
This repository is dedicated to the event detection task, which constitutes my **Homework 1** for the course **MULTILINGUAL NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING**, part of my Masterâ€™s in AI and Robotics at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/it/pagina-strutturale/home). The project explores three different approaches to event detection:

* **Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) without pre-trained word embeddings:** Examines the baseline capabilities of BiLSTM in event detection.
* **Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) with pre-trained word embeddings:** Investigates the impact of leveraging pre-trained embeddings on the model's performance.
* **Bidirectional LSTM with Conditional Random Field (CRF):** Assesses the combined approach for improved event classification accuracy.

Each method is meticulously analyzed to determine its effectiveness in accurately identifying events within the text, providing a holistic view of current techniques in the field.
